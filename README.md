# outsystems-elastic-integration

**This project contains [Elastic](https://elastic.co/) accelerators to have greater and faster insights of the [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/) monitoring data.**

**The accelerators are:**
1. The **_Logstash_ code** to fetch data from the OutSystems Platform
2. The **_Kibana_ JSON visualizations definitions** definitions to be able to easily observe applications and Plaform performance and errors

Deeper information of these accelerators are available at this [Wiki](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-elastic-integration/wiki) repository. More specificallyÂ [here](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-elastic-integration/wiki/Elastic-Accelerators-Information).

## Accelerators goals
**Accelerate the ability of:**
1. Easily **observe the OutSystems monitoring data on Elastic with more advanced visualizations** that the ones available natively on the OutSystems administration tools;
2. Easily be able to search on OutSystems monitoring data, in particular on the OutSystems logs with:
    1. Free text search;
    2. Manipulation of the visible information. 
3. **Do more advance monitoring** that the ones available natively on the OutSystems administration tools. Like:
    1. Build an alerting system for an OutSystems environemnt or OutSystems Factory;
    2. Leverage Elastic analytics capabilities to have deeper insights of performance and behaviour of OutSystems Platform and applications;
    3. Etc.
3. **Be able to observe OutSystems applications and Platform _performance_ and _errors_ through time**;
    1. And quickly understand performance bottlenecks, areas to improve, etc.
    2. Be able to understand if performance is affected by:
        1. _Slow Queries_
        2. _Slow Integrations_
        3. _Slow Extensions_ 


### Examples of **_OutSystems_ monitoring metrics** possible to measure with this approach:
1. Request Time Duration
    And for each request:
    1. Client Time (load time)
    2. Server Time
    And on the server side:
        1. SAT (Session Acquisition Time)
        2. Query Execution Time
        3. Integration Execution Time
        2. Extension Execution Time
2. Server side performance metrics
    1. Session size
    2. Viewstate size
    3. Number of slow queries
    4. Number of slow integrations
    5. Number of slow extensions
3. Errors metrics
    1. Number of Errors
    2. Number of Errors by type 

*Important Notes*
- These metrics are the ones what *OutSystems Customer Success Experts* teams consider a starting point to understand applications and Platform performance; 
- As stated these are just examples of some of the metrics possible to monitor and/or calculate based on the *OutSystems* monitoring data on an Elastic instance.
